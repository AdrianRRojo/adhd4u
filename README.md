# ADHD4U

## Description
---
As a programmer with ADHD, I know firsthand the challenges that come with managing this condition. It can be difficult to stay focused, prioritize tasks, and stay organized, which can make it hard to succeed in a demanding field like programming. That's why I decided to create a website called ADHD4U, which offers free tools and resources for individuals with ADHD.
ADHD4U features a variety of tools that are specifically designed to help individuals with ADHD manage their symptoms and improve their daily functioning.
I have attempted to use other tools, but many of the best tools I found involve paying for their service.
I encourage anyone with ADHD to check out ADHD4U and take advantage of the free tools and resources available on the website.

## Features / User stories
---
- The symptom tracker allows users to track their symptoms over time and identify patterns that may be contributing to their ADHD. 
- The medication tracker helps users keep track of their medication schedule and monitor their response to different treatments. 
- The planner and calendar allows users to organize their daily activities.
- The timer allows users to stay focused on a task, and manage their time effectively. 
- But what I think sets ADHD4U apart is the supportive community forum. Here, users can connect with others who have ADHD and share tips and strategies for managing their symptoms. It's a great resource for anyone with ADHD who is looking for support and guidance.
